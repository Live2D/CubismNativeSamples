## Cubism Native Framework

Provides various functions for displaying and manipulating the model.

[Cubism Native Framework] is included as a submodule of this repository.
After cloning this repository, the files will be added by cloning the submodule.

[Cubism Native Framework]: (https://github.com/Live2D/CubismNativeFramework)


## Live2D Cubism Core for Native

A library for loading the model.
Live2D Cubism Core for Native is not included in this repository.

To download, please refer to [this](https://www.live2d.com/download/cubism-sdk/download-native/) page.
Copy the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to the `Core` directory of this repository and link it to the program.


## How to build

The build method depends on the sample project.
Please refer to the `README.md` included with each sample project.

### Where to generate the sample project deliverables

In this sample, the deliverables of CMake projects except Android are generated in the `bin` directory.

E.g. When building a macOS project of the OpenGL sample using the `make_gcc` script
```
Demo
└─ proj.mac.cmake
   └─ build
      └─ make_gcc
         └─ bin
            └─ Demo
               ├─ Resources    # Same as Samples/Resources
               └─ Demo         # Executable applications
```


## Compile options

If the macro `USE_RENDER_TARGET` or `USE_MODEL_RENDER_TARGET` is enabled in your project, the model will be rendered to the texture.
Please refer to 'LAppLive2DManager.cpp' in the sample directory for details.
