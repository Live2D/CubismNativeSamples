## Demo

A sample that uses each function of [Cubism Native Framework].

There are two types of samples: the full version that uses all the features, and the minimum version that has only minimal features.

In the full version, you can play motions, set facial expressions, switch poses, set physics, etc.
You can also switch models from the menu button.

In the minimum version, you can load and display a single model, play a single motion, set facial expressions, set physics, etc.
Switching poses and models are not supported.

The items contained in this directory are as follows.

### proj.d3d11.cmake

CMake project.

Running the script in the `script` directory will generate a CMake deliverable in the `build` directory.

| Script name | Product |
| --- | --- |
| `nmake_msvcXXXX.bat` | Executable application |
| `proj_msvcXXXX.bat` | Visual Studio project |

When you run these scripts, you can choose to generate the full version or the minimum version of the sample.

[DirectXTK] is used as a development kit.
Please refer to the [thirdParty](README.md#thirdParty) section and download in advance.
